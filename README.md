In this sentiment analysis project, we utilized a logistic regression model in Python with the scikit-learn library, as part of a pipeline that includes a CountVectorizer for text feature extraction. The goal was to classify text data into joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise sentiment categories based on a labeled dataset.
The accuracy of our logistic regression model was found to be around 70%, with average performance in terms of other evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. While the model demonstrated promising results, there is room for further improvements.
One of the key components of our pipeline was the CountVectorizer, which helped us transform the text data into numerical features that could be used as input to the logistic regression model. This approach allowed us to capture the word frequency information, which proved to be valuable in differentiating between joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise sentiment in the text data.
The logistic regression model, being a simple yet powerful algorithm for binary classification, demonstrated its effectiveness in our sentiment analysis project. It learned to classify text data into joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise sentiment categories based on the features extracted by the CountVectorizer. However, it's worth noting that the performance of the model heavily relies on the quality and representativeness of the labeled dataset used for training.
Overall, our sentiment analysis project using logistic regression with CountVectorizer as part of a pipeline in Python showed promising results in terms of accuracy and other evaluation metrics. Further improvements could be made by considering other feature extraction techniques, incorporating more advanced machine learning algorithms, or expanding the labeled dataset for training. This project provides a solid foundation for further research and development in sentiment analysis using logistic regression and scikit-learn in Python.
